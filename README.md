This website hosts a growing collection of posterior distributions, with an emphasis on difficult problems (non-log-concave).

For each problem, we use [Pigeons](https://pigeons.run/) to provide a reference, high-quality approximation, with 
visualization of the posterior and diagnostics produced by [InferenceReport](https://github.com/Julia-Tempering/InferenceReport.jl).
